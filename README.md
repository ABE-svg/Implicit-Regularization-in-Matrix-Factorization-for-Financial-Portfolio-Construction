# 💼 Implicit Regularization in Matrix Factorization for Financial Portfolio Construction

## 🧠 Overview
This project investigates the role of **implicit regularization** in **matrix factorization methods** applied to **financial portfolio construction**.  
The objective is to understand how optimization dynamics (learning rate, initialization, early stopping) affect factor structures and, consequently, portfolio performance.

The project follows an applied research structure combining **machine learning**, **finance**, and **optimization theory**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the theoretical foundations of **implicit vs. explicit regularization**.
- Implement and compare **matrix factorization models** (SVD, PCA, NMF, Gradient Descent-based).
- Evaluate how implicit regularization shapes latent factors in financial returns matrices.
- Build **factor-based portfolios** and benchmark them against traditional **Markowitz portfolios**.
- Backtest and interpret performance metrics across time.
